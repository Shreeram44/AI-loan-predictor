AI Loan Predictor
Overview
The “AI Loan Predictor” is a machine learning project that aims to predict loan approval based on historical data. By analyzing various features such as income, credit score, and loan amount, the model provides insights into whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand its distribution, correlations, and key insights.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost) and select the best-performing one.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the chosen model on the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
Deployment: Deploy the trained model using a web framework (e.g., Flask) to create an interactive loan prediction tool.
